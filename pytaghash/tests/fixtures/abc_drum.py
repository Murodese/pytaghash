        <p>Abbott displays all the hallmarks of a highly delusional right-man. He appears egotistical in the extreme and it should now be obvious to all that he is an extremely dangerous individual and one who should never be in a position of power, let alone being leader of a nation</p>

                        Tony Abbott displayed all of his head kicking prowess as Leader of the Opposition so the LNP would have been fully aware of who they were appointing as team captain. The problem that they now have is that the transition from opposition to government is proving more difficult than expected and the skipper's form on the field is more about playing deep in defence than kicking goals.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>There is something boyishly rebellious about the way this Prime Minister avoids advice. It's not that he forgets to seek it, it's that he actively evades it, writes Annabel Crabb.</em></strong></p>

                        <p>One thing of which the modern political leader never runs short is advice.</p>

                        <p>Like footy coaches, they are regularly exposed to the stray thoughts of just about everyone they meet on the subject of how they might consider doing their job better.</p>

                        <p>Shoppers, joggers, restaurant patrons, columnists, talkback callers, bajillionaire foreign media moguls; the sources of unsolicited counsel for politicians are endless.</p>

                        <p>Politicians are all different, but it's funny the way they all tend to get the same look when approached by an advice-bearing stranger; a sort of frozen half-smile up top, while below, their feet arrange themselves for flight.</p>

                        <p>The really terrible thing about advice is that the more you get of it, the worse you're doing.</p>

                        <p>And when you're doing really badly, then the advice you get is very often that you should be getting better advice.</p>

                        <p>There's been a fair bit of this sort of thing around this week, as the nation struggles to come up with a rational explanation for the Prime Minister's decision to start what promises to be a punchy year by quite literally putting up his Dukes.</p>

                        <p>"Why didn't anyone stop him?" is a commonly-asked question, and the accusatory gaze has fallen, naturally enough, on the Prime Minister's closest adviser, his chief of staff Peta Credlin, who ordinarily is criticised for bossing Mr Abbott around too much but this week is in trouble for not bossing him enough.</p>

                        <p>It's one of the strangest aspects of contemporary politics - the way errors are commonly blamed not on the foolishness of a leader, but on some kind of procedural failure to ask enough people whether you're about to make a goose of yourself.</p>

                        <p>"What the hell are her advisers doing?" was something you heard a lot during the Gillard period of government, too. But in the end, political advice can't ever make a bad prime minister into a good one. And Kevin Rudd - the prime minister who was famous for his ceaseless commissioning of extra advice, research, reports and expert opinion - ended up ensnarled in so much advice that he drowned in it, unable to make decisions.</p>

                        <p>Of all the key performance indicators stapled to the job of prime minister, judgment - or knowing how much you can get away with in the pursuit of the changes you want to make - is probably the most important, day to day.</p>

                        <p>There are plenty of examples of prime ministers taking extreme political risks against political advice, and succeeding; think of John Howard in 1998, compounding a miserable first term by deciding to fight a re-election campaign on the introduction of a GST.</p>

                        <p>The taking of advice is sometimes more useful for the ameliorative act of listening to those around you, and thus making them feel involved, than it is for the actual worth of the advice proffered. This was something Mr Howard, who regularly sought the views of backbenchers, understood well.</p>

                        <p>"Advice is what we ask for when we know the answer, but wish we didn't," wrote Erica Jong.</p>

                        <p>And there is something boyishly rebellious about the way this Prime Minister avoids advice. It's not that he forgets to seek it, it's that he actively evades it - especially on occasions where he knows what he'd probably hear.</p>

                        <p>"It is better to seek forgiveness than to ask permission," went Mr Abbott's famously sheepish half-apology for announcing the paid parental leave policy without asking any of his colleagues about it first. He didn't ask - not because he didn't want to know what they thought, but because he already knew. There's a difference.</p>

                                    <p>Abbott displays all the hallmarks of a highly delusional right-man. He appears egotistical in the extreme and it should now be obvious to all that he is an extremely dangerous individual and one who should never be in a position of power, let alone being leader of a nation</p>

                                                    Tony Abbott displayed all of his head kicking prowess as Leader of the Opposition so the LNP would have been fully aware of who they were appointing as team captain. The problem that they now have is that the transition from opposition to government is proving more difficult than expected and the skipper's form on the field is more about playing deep in defence than kicking goals.</p>

This episode from Abbott and the slowly emerging support his government are starting to offer him only shows that none of the Coalition policy agendas can be considered as thought through on merit. We are talking about complete chaos amid a vaccum of intelligence on an unprecedented scale. Tony and his ministers should do their patriotic duty and stand aside and hand government back to the adults.</p>

                                                            <p>I think there is a lot of truth in this. Back when Abbott was elected, the Liberal Party was in real financial trouble. Questions were being asked about their ability to finance an election campaign and they were very concerned they could no longer compete with the ALP for funding. One of the big advantages of Abbot over Turnbull was that he was offering a large influx of political donations. In fact, since the appointment of Abbott, the financal picture for the Liberal Party has completely turned around as they have raked in the donations - now having a much larger electoral war chest than the ALP.</p>

                                                    <p>Annabell I do believe you picked a pretty ordinary example in Howards 1998 early election. If I remember correctly the Labor Party actually received 52% of the national vote and Howard snuck in to power courtesy of the gerrymandering he had done on various electorates. He most certainly had no mandate for the GST but brought it in anyway. You would think that Abbott could learn for that example but I do not believe him capable of receiving and acting on the advice of people he thinks beneath him. The more he makes these foolish gaffes the we true believers like it. Roll on 2016</p>

                                            <p>I am not surprised that it has reach this point, Abbott's shortcomings were there for all to see through out his political life.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Leaders need a vision. They need to sell that vision and then deliver that vision.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Abbott was allowed to get away hiding his &quot;light&quot; under a bushel.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            He told us he lied but people ignored that comment.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            He told us he didn't really care for the poor or unemployed but people ignored those numerous comments.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            He demonstrated his contempt or women and again people ignored those comments.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            People wanted to believe he was something he wasn't and now the nation is suffering.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Do I add I told you so?<br>

Apparently a comment to one person. Sometimes, 'reports' are twisted to suit a story as I'm sure you would know?<br>
                                                            I have no idea of course but I have heard and read many times that Abbott is actually a very genuine and likeable person in the flesh but obviously when he is so hated by some in the community, mainly from the left and given his propensity of late to make some silly decisions, it's easy for the anti Abbott brigades to say anything they like and it will very often simply be accepted as genuine. As you have no doubt worked out, I am a supporter of the Liberal governments because they seem to have the right outlook to improve the country, unlike the last two PM's but I am also happy enough to admit that Abbott has so far been a disappointment in some areas but he does have around 18 months to get his act together whereas Shorten has already indicated when and if he is elected, he will reintroduce the very policies that got Labor chucked out so what has he learnt?<br>
                                                            I am still waiting to hear the incident where he showed contempt for women?<br></p>

                                                    <p>So politicians, as a group, are of above average intelligence? Last time I heard, Rhodes scholars were selected on a number of grounds but commonsense doesn't seem to be one of them in Mr Abbott's case.</p>

                                            <p>Several possibilities;<br>
                                            <br>
                                            1) She's a normal human being of average IQ or above, and can work it out for herself.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            2) She called me up and got my take on things, because I'm usually a pretty good suppository of wisdom on stuff like this. For example, Paula Matthewson reads and regurgitates my thoughts constantly - with a respectable pause to take any claims of plagiarism out of the equation obviously.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            3) She listened intently to what Kevin Andrews said and wrote down whatever was diametrically opposed to that.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            4) She decided that in the interests of &quot;balance&quot; (something that gets a run here at The Drum every half-hour or so) it would be necessary to juxtapose some mild and somewhat calm analysis with the fevered hatred pouring out of the News Limited stables at present from all of Abbott's hitherto jovial mates. I personally favour this last one, simply because she strikes me as someone with a rather impish sense of humour.</p>

                                                    <p>Funny... and sadly so true, especially the K Andrews point. There is many a political mile in that little gem. Indeed I could easily see it as the next platform for the Liberal/Nats Coalition (never forget folks that it is a coalition because they can't do it on their lonesome) Federal election campaign with a new leader. They just ask Andrews what he thinks and then announce the opposite - it cannot fail.</p>

                                                    <p>Well, he left Joe hockey to take all of the fall for a budget that he directed, with no Howard-like 'I support this budget and the Treasurer' speeches. He reshuffled Kevin Andrews from the health portfolio after his final decision on the $7 co-payment proved unpopular, then also left it up to Susan Ley on pretty much her first day to take the fall for the doctor's $5 co-payment and retraction, instead of explaining it himself. Also, he's the P.M, all the final decisions come to him to be decided, that's the role.</p>

                                    <p>An interesting article that's got me thinking about classes of advice. I can understand our Prime Minister not necessarily heeding advice that's just an opinion without any basis in fact or knowledge. John Howard appears to have disregarded this form of advice when he decided to run a re-election campaign on the introduction of a GST. It becomes a little unsafe, however, when the advice concerns prudent future actions and is based on diligent analysis and the best of knowledge. Climate change fits here. So does the approach to our economy which ought not derive from what appears to be intellectual mediocrity. One drawback with advice of the second sort is that effort needs to be expended..</p>

                                    <p>You're right, Annabel - Abbott doesn't simply forget to listen, rather, he actively avoids advice because he knows it will stymie what he wants to do.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    His mission in office has not been to impose party ideology on Australia. It's much, much worse than that. He has attempted to impose his private, skewed ideology onto the very core of this nation, rather like attempting to graft a thistle onto a gum tree and expecting it to thrive.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The &quot;storm in a teacup&quot; that could have been Knightsgate has become &quot;the perfect storm&quot;. He won't survive this.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even the so called support of some of his loyal ministers is nothing more than them being careful not to be seen as trying to destabilise him. They, like all of us, know his time is up, and are keeping their noses clean so nothing can come back to bite them if they are given the top job.<br>

                                            <p>Apparently &quot;to be a leader&quot; you'd need to canvass opinion about handing an honour to a 93 year old who has given a life of public service and lack of privacy to the Commonwealth because the twits that inhabit &quot;social media&quot; don't know a thing about the tradition of honours.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            His lack of leadership is better revealed by not telling the &quot;media commentators&quot; that they have all lost their collective minds and ability to reason. He should have added that Canada and NZ have given him their highest honours as recently as 2013 and that he is a worthy recipient. That he holds the highest rank in each of our armed services and was conferred our previous highest public service honour by Bob Hawke.<br>
                                            He should have finished by telling the pack of blithering morons that embody the &quot;media gallery&quot; that they don't have the mental capacity to analyse or criticise the $300B that was pissed up against the wall by the previous govt but they can spend days in an orgy of faux outrage about an award that cost us nothing but conveyed our nation's appreciation for The Duke's patronage and support of organisations that do tangible good for our society.</p>

                                            <p>The political roundup on 702 this afternoon had some journo on it who came up with a very astute observation.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            He said the role of the PM is to govern for all Australian, not just for yourself, or those that vote for you, or donate to your campaign.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            That sums Tony up to tee. The PM-ship was the prize Abbott so dearly wanted he spent so much effort destroying all his opposition he forgot the very important part about preparing himself for office. Pity was he showed throughout his entire career the absolute lightweight overly ambitious incompetent he is, yet conned enough people to get the top job.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Australia would have been well served had Tony gone the way of Mark Latham. It took an election flogging to show the Labor Party what a goose Latham was. Tony on the other hand is flogging himself.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The Labor Party must be loving this. Tony is the gift that just keep giving.</p>

A similar thing appears to be happening in the Abbott government with Peta Credlin overseeing all media interviews for government ministers and giving the final approval for all appointments of ministerial staff. Micromanagement always fails.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The formation of policy should follow a standard process to ensure that it gets sufficient review before being announced publically and adherance to this process should be enforced. Further still, key roles in both the PM's and Ministers offices should be filled by professional public servants who are well versed in the ways of government and can advise the minister of how things should be done. Using inexperienced political advisors from the party who've been raised to positions of power purley because their respective MP got promoted to Minister will generally produce bad results. Such people generally have no relevant qualifications or experience and go onto provide bad advice.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Process may seem like a pain in the neck and it can take more time but it does at least produce results of a more consistent quality.<br></p>

                                            <p>I agree Lilly. We have a good historical example of failure to heed sound professional advice on public policy. It concerns the Mr Fluffy asbestos debacle currently being played out in Canberra. Australia's Chief Health Officer gave a clear warning of what was about to happen - very, very early. This advice to the Commonwealth government is on record. Did this professional advice receive a respectful hearing that should have been accompanied by a respectful reply setting out reasons for not responding to it?. Look at how much this lapse of reasonable process is costing us now. The fallout from the Mr Fluffy issue could lead to the institution of procedural standards for scientific and other professional advice into public policy, perhaps when there's a change of government.</p>

                                            There are standard procedures for all appointments that involve public expenditure - selection by an impartial panel based on applications received after an open advertisement and a position statement.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Policy is developed by trained policy analysts following a standard methodology (there are plenty of skilled analysts in Treasure and the Government departments).<br>

                                            Good governance is hard, often slow and boring work. I suspect the public and the media are as much to blame.</p>

                                            <p>What you are describing here lilly is what has been available to ministers for the past 50 or 100 years. Every minister has a department full of experts who are on tap to provide advice either formally or in some cases over the phone. A competent minister should know who to speak to and so would their assistants. There is even a section in the prime ministers department with responsibility for honours and awards but it hasn't rated a mention.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            This is not to say I disagree with what you say, particularly about advisors. Calling them that instead of assistants is part of the problem - it has given them delusions of power beyond anything ever intended. Hopefully future ministers will not fall into the same Abbott trap.</p>

                                    <p>The main problem with Abbott is that he seems to just act on impulse. You really can't advise someone on something if you don't know what they are going to do or say beforehand.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The main difference between a statesman &amp; Abbott is that they do seek advice &amp; consensus within the group before making an announcement or a policy change.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I would not put this in the &quot;boyish&quot; behaviour category, it's well beyond that as we have seen with so many of these ill thought out actions &amp; sayings.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I really can't understand why the party are continuing to stand behind &amp; back him when he clearly has lost the respect of the electorate. It's clearly time for him to pack his back &amp; go as it will only be, what, a week of two until the next gaff &amp; they will have to go through the job of supporting him yet again.</p>

                                    <p>Tony Abbott has never been one to sniff the political winds, weigh up the consequences and take the easiest and supposedly most popular course of action (he leaves that to Labor).<br>
                                    I wish he would explain his decisions to his colleagues and the public a little clearer, but at least he gets on with it and does what he believes is right.<br>
                                    Over time, it will be the electorates decision whether they back him, or not. One thing is for certain - he won't turn around in the cabinet room to find half a dozen knives in his back.</p>

                                    <p>&quot;It's one of the strangest aspects of contemporary politics - the way errors are commonly blamed not on the foolishness of a leader, but on some kind of procedural failure to ask enough people whether you're about to make a goose of yourself.&quot;<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A very strange aspect of many analysers of Abbott's performance of very recent times is to avoid the obvious core reason for the government's woes and Crabb might now be one of them. Abbott's failure to take advice is not the obvious core reason for the government's woes.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    BTW I am fairly confident &quot;It is better to seek forgiveness than to ask permission,&quot; is not a precise quote by omission of one word. I do not think that was a sheepish half-apology (neither am I implying it is part of the obvious core reason for the government's woes). Abbott is far less inclined to apologise for anything than his PM predecessors.</p>

                                    <p>Surely the purpose of seeking advice is so to obtain different views on the subject matter so that as leader you may then adjust your policy to use the best of the advice given before announcing it all to the parliament and public. Alternately as leader you may shelve the policy at that time to be revisited at a more suitable time. People who either do not seek advice or take no heed of it when it is given are often egotistical autocrats who sooner or later are brought down to earth with a thump when all and sundry reject the leader rather than the policy. We have seen it all before.</p>

                                    <p>Tony Abbott becoming PM based on a dishonest , vindictive and negative campaign with a complete absence of any policy was achieved on the back of a compliant media that failed to hold him to account.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    On the rare occasions he was ( Sales re BHP and Abbott, Kerry O'Brien and Abbott and the internet spring to mind) his complete unfitness was demonstrated yet somehow the media allowed this to pass as some kind of &quot;Tonyism&quot; and that it would be all right on the night. Besides it was a lot more fun to vilify Gillard and ignore real achieb=vement and substance.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The utter failure ( the most complete of any Australian PM even McMahon) is not that of Abbott. It is a failure of the Fourth Estate who failed in their unwritten but nevertheless absolute covenant to actual act as reporters not recycle press handouts and act as kingmakers.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Look At Newan in Qld refusing to answer questions. Why didn't the reports just walk out and ignore him and report on what they could find out and comment accordingly.<br></p>

                                    Many Liberal backbenchers and some frontbenchers would love to get rid of both of them.<br>

                                    I stand here, in deep existential anguish, torn between the various possibilities and uncertain about what to do and what to think.... I urgently need some advice: Can we ask the Australian Voters?<br></p>

                                    As an artist one gets advice all the time, if one lets it happen. I can see it happening to politicians as well it would drive them batty.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    A leader has to have a strong vision. He has to be able to cut through advice that would lead him astray from that vision. Abbott's problem in my opinion is his vision has been impacted by his upbringing.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If half of the stories about him are true he has always been headstrong and a bully. He is no different now then he was when he was elected. His vision is strong but it is full of misinformation.<br>

                                    <p>People never talk about it in any depth, and it is not entirely on topic, but I will throw it out there to see what people think.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    In someone who is the PM of a small but not unimportant nation with all the personal qualities and skills that requires, what does the decision to never wear anything but a blue tie say about his personality and psychology. Don't tell me it is a fashion statement, he has worn other colours.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    What does it say about the line between determination and bloody-mindedness, obsession about something so trivial, ability to be flexible when flexibility is needed? Seems like an unhealthy rigidity of mind in someone in a position which requires much more nuance and thoughtfulness. Any thoughts?</p>

                                            I've taken it to mean that Abbott is a person who somehow forms an opinion, and then cannot, regardless of circumstances, including new information, change that opinion. This fits with his approach to religion.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            His tie matches his ideology - not always appropriate to the circumstances, and hanging round his neck.</p>

                                    <p>Abbott is not a boy and he is certainly not boyish.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The only thing that can be said of a politician that refuse a dive is that he should not be a politician.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Why, because politicians are rarely experts on the portfolios they hold if they are ministers and Abbott, taking his current record into account should be seeking all the advice he can get instead of running from any advice he is offered.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Perhaps, a good politician is one that actually seeks out expert advice, from a number of different sources, in recognition of the fact that he or she is not trained in most of the areas on which they will be making policy.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is at present, in the LNP, a lack of humility and a surfeit of arrogance when it come to politicians taking advice. This needs to change before anyone can take the LNP seriously considering their appalling tack record in this parliament.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    Or perhaps all the ABC can do is Tony Abbott and the Stories are all the same just a different ABC journalist. Anyway it's really boring.</p>

                                    Mr Abbott is not being paid to be rebellious. He's being paid to do what the majority of Australians want.

Don't do what the majority want and you will be put in naughty corner.</p>

                                    Ahh, the vext question of leadership. We are caught in the echoes of the Cold War. Ideologies and nuclear missiles at thirty paces. Tony Abbot is Prime Minister of The Commonwealth of Australia. Is that role to listen to some of the best educated minds in the world and guide the drafting of the laws by which we govern our society and debate/struggle with fellow parliamentarians, bureaucrats, constituents and general citizenry, the question of - what is a good society? Or is that role to bounce out of some right wing echo chamber and set about activating a neo-liberal/laissez-fair ideology.I am sorry, but an economic model that had its first trial run in Chile under the rule of General Pinoche is not a model that inspires confidence.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Can't we move beyond ideological stand-offs and ask simple questions like what is the proper role of the state, what sort of society do we want, how best to limit the role of government so that it doesn't impede the in-built creativity, freedom and joy of citizens while providing sound physical and social infrastructure, resolving the negative externalities of the market and wisely intervening to resolve those situations where we all, occasionally, become a little bit irrational?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Is that too much to ask? Some good leadership? If Tony Abbot has isolated himself I feel sorry for him. His role as a leader could be some of the best years in his life, where the cut and thrust of politics was tempered with real debate about how to best govern this wonderful country.<br>

                                    <p>TO be truthful I think Tony's decision to award husband of his boss's boss was not uncharacteristic of his past style. During his days as opposition leader crazier he behaved, the happier all the conservative lot became. So much so that even Labor voters joined the pied-piper.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Tony is just playing the same game with the same level of enthusiasm.</p>

                                    <p>The LNP appointed someone who was good at saying NO in opposition and is now a terrible leader. He has the same terrible judgement, as those who appointed him leader by one vote. We deserve better and the LNP are now finally realising this. But stick with him, there is no better way to ensure a change in government at the next election. There is no credibility left.</p>

                                    <p>The Liberal Party has gone through its Rudd moment. The ALP chose a person as its leader someone who was clearly unsuitable ...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We can wonder why a group of intelligent and politically savvy people chose as its leader one that they knew was likely to cause more harm than good.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Is Abbott in the Rudd category? Perhaps not to the same extent .... but almost.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The only hope for the Liberal Party is to arrange, unlike the ALP, for a dignified transition which the nation understands.</p>

                                    <p>There is nothing in the least 'boyishly rebellious&quot; about an almost 60 year old man in Abbott's position as prime minister refusing to seek advice on a matter as fraught as giving a Knighthood to a British royal on Australia Day of all days. It is just plain stupidity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    As for seeking forgiveness rather than asking permission... young children are renowned for doing things they know they shouldn't and then crying, 'sorry, sorry I didn't mean it' to escape punishment.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Abbott has been getting away with this type of juvenile nonsense for decades... It has finally caught up with him...<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <p>My disappointment cannot be described, but Last night I dreamed this, could it be that Tony Abbot is a clone of Prince Phillips?<br>
                                    Phillips his prone for well documented gaffes and his wife put a leash on him few decades back, I urge Tony wife do the same or Julie Bishop will sink him soon.<br>
                                    The moron is still convince that he done a great favour to Australia, actually we are the joke of the world.<br>
                                    Andrew Bolt should receive the honour not the Prince, and also lets see what comes out of an inquest for the treatment of Abbot daughters at University.<br></p>

    <meta content="Two WA backbenchers have posted their intention to move, on Tuesday, for a spill of the Liberal Party leadership. The main prospect as a challenger is and has always been Malcolm Bligh Turnbull. He has not declared himself to be a candidate. He has been studiously cautious about canvassing the issue with colleagues. If internecine political warfare has changed, then Malcolm Turnbull is one jungle-dweller who has evolved as effortlessly as Schwarzenegger." name="description">

                        <p><strong><em>If the motion to spill the leadership of the Liberal Party leadership succeeds, the main prospect as a challenger is and has always been Malcolm Turnbull, who has transformed himself to a milder, more patient and less pushy political figure, writes Annabel Crabb.</em></strong></p>

                        <p>From the jungly commando warfare that has occupied the Coalition over the last two torrid weeks, a familiar battle-cry has now clearly emerged: "If it leads, we can kill it."</p>

                        <p>This afternoon, two WA backbenchers have posted their intention to move, on Tuesday, for a spill of the Liberal Party leadership, five-and-a-bit years and two elections and four prime ministers on from its memorable capture by Tony Abbott with the heart-stopping margin of one single vote.</p>

                        <p>The message: No leader is safe any more. Not in their first term, not ever. The threat has evolved.</p>

                        <p>Internecine political warfare has changed a lot. In the old days, it was slower. You'd start off with a challenger and go from there. Sometimes, you'd start with a challenger - Peter Costello, say - and then nothing would happen for eight years.</p>

                        <p>On one memorable occasion in 2007, John Howard even asked his Cabinet whether they thought he should go. By the time they answered ("Yes"), he was out of his consultative patch and the moment was lost.</p>

                        <p>These days, you don't even need to start with a challenger.</p>

                        <p>These days, dissatisfaction plus a multi-headed media hydra will get you to crisis point even if - as in this present situation - none of the purported leadership alternatives has sought to bring things to a head.</p>

                        <p>Can Tony Abbott survive on Tuesday? Possibly. Can he survive long-term? Hmmm. Put it this way: Barnaby Joyce last week bet his house on Tony Abbott still leading the Coalition at the next election. He would want to be checking his mortgage insurance.</p>

                        <p>Mr Abbott has just made a terse appearance at Sydney's Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices to declare that he and his deputy, Julie Bishop, have spoken and have agreed to stand together - leader and deputy - to contest any motion to spill.</p>

                        <p>"We are not the Labor Party," he further and uncontroversially declared, before disappearing from the shortest press conference I can ever recall seeing.</p>

                        <p>Ms Bishop's absence from her leader's side does not necessarily mean that she has been tied up somewhere by Peta Credlin; she has been in Adelaide, playing awkwardly with preschoolers in the company of a sub-ebullient Christopher Pyne.</p>

                        <p>The question of whether Ms Bishop's support would continue in the event that the spill motion succeeds is still unanswered.</p>

                        <p>But the full support of Ms Bishop has never, in any event, been a guarantor of ballot triumph; she supported Brendan Nelson all the way to his defeat in 2008, and she supported his successor, Malcolm Turnbull, right up to the point at which he was knocked over by Mr Abbott in late 2009.</p>

                        <p>In any event, the main prospect as a challenger is and - realistically - has always been Malcolm Bligh Turnbull.</p>

                        <p>He has not declared himself to be a candidate. He has been studiously cautious about canvassing the issue with colleagues.</p>

                        <p>If internecine political warfare has changed, then Malcolm Turnbull is one jungle-dweller who has evolved as effortlessly as Schwarzenegger.</p>

                        <p>The old Malcolm, who strutted and fretted under Brendan Nelson's leadership and whose ambition to take over was so red-hot it was palpable across a crowded room, is nowhere to be seen these days.</p>

                        <p>New Malcolm is milder, more patient, less pushy. Less prickly; the "metadata" fiasco, which last year saw the PM and George Brandis both stumble rather badly on some technical detail within Turnbull's portfolio rather than just doing the obvious thing and including him in the discussion, would have sent Old Malcolm into Rage Orbit. But he helped to fix the situation, and refrained from making a fuss.</p>

                        <p>Internally, Turnbull has been reported as encouraging colleagues to give the PM more time. That in itself is not a qualification for saintliness; more time would suit Turnbull.</p>

                                            <p>Tom1 - Overall I don't think it matters much in the political scheme of things in Australia if Turnbull succeeds Abbot - the Coalition and its various aliases in the states LNP, CLP, etc. are just plain on the nose and out of talent. Turnbull might win, he might not but even if Abbott manages a Howard like Lazarus revival he will forever doomed to revisit the challenge and will in time succumb. Turnbull is not a choice I'd make, in fact I don't see a single occupant on the Coalition front bench that I would like as PM of Australia.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The Coalition simply has to do the honest thing for once, admit it is not born to rule and whatever the outcome of the spill go to an election. That way Australia can be rid of that generation of conservatives in the hope that upcoming Liberals will have seen the error of trying to revisit the spirit of Cold War Warriors like Thatcher and Reagan. They are yesterday's politicians whose ideology died with them and Australia deserves some progressive politicians who can live in the 21st Century with ease.</p>

                                    <p>If I was Mal I would leave Tony Abbot to keep digging his hole for himself.<br>
                                    Mal going into the top job now would be like Rudd going into a no win situation at the last election. Abbot made this mess and he needs to face the music.<br></p>

                                            <p>I agree 100%. There is no point in Malcolm taking the leadership as long as the extreme right Tea Party types are dominating policy. Much better for Abbott to stay there and lose the next election. Maybe then the far right will realise that it was not about explaining policies better; we understand the policies perfectly and we reject them!</p>

                                    <p>If I am Turnbull, I will only be too pleased to wait. Yes, give Abbott that like bit more slack to stuff up more. Give him space to mess up to the point when the LNP wakes up to the fact that Malcolm's rules OK.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Right now, many LNP MP, especially those with the most to lose, ie. the cabinet ministers, know that if there is a leadership change, their hold on the portfolio is on shaky ground. So they are urging everyone to hold hands, form a tight circle, and tread water as hard and as fast as they can. Joe Hockey knows that if Turnbull is in charge, his job is gone. Did anyone noticed how desperate he was appealing to people not to change leader?<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Pyne, surprisingly, kept a very low profile. He is a clever political animal. Although he claimed to support Abbott, still, but one can detect the subtle lacking in enthusiasm. He is betting a bob each way. Clever chap he is.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Julie Bishop will not amount to much as she will sway with the stiffest wind, regardless of which direction it is coming from. Her records as a deputy to many &quot;has-been&quot; challengers and losers in leadership spills are proofs.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I believe Bill Shorten will only be too happy to have Abbott in the director's chair. But that is not a healthy situation as competition produces the best outcome. But who is dreaming of a best outcome in politics? Is there one in the first place?</p>

                                    A politician and a statesman (or woman) are not the same animal at all.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It has been said a statesman has the following qualities.<br>
                                    1. A bedrock of principles<br>
                                    2. A moral compass<br>
                                    3. A vision<br>
                                    4. The ability to build a consensus to achieve that vision<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I despair for Australia with the absolute clueless clowns that sit on both sides.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    We are doomed by politicians who believe that by undertaking the same actions of the previous Government, it will be different this time.<br>

                                    <p>While one hopes the spill will replace Abbott, what does that really mean? Will Turnbull change the policies, provide a future for Australia we simple folk can all understand?<br>

                                    That is what is needed, clear and clean speaking, truth well explained, not more core and non-core. No more being led by others outside of politics. This country is too valuable and cherished by Australians of all religions, politics, race and social standing to put up with any further rubbish.</p>

                                    <p>Malcolm Turnbull was hopeless as liberal leader last time and he would not be any different if the Liberals are silly enough to reinstate him as leader. Mr. Turnbull's ideology is more in tune with Labor, that's why most Labor supporters want him to lead the Liberal party. If anything, Malcolm should challenge Bill Shorten and go to the party he belongs with.</p>

                                            <p>I will never understand this party's priorities. Why did Abbott lose support from his own ilk over a silly knighthood? He broke series of promises, and had no mandate to attack Medicare, the ABC, the CSIRO, the universities. But they rile when a Pom gives an Australian gong to a Greek married into a German dynasty? These people deserve our support and our understanding, but they should not be in government.</p>

                                            <p>I'm going to do my bit. As soon as I finish here all news services will be ignored until at least next Thursday. I give up on the constant media circus. Like Big Brother it was mildly amusing the first time but then just becomes painful and tiresome weather its Libs, Lab, Green or any of the tiddlers in the media gun sites.<br>
                                            Just my way of &quot;Do Not Feed The Troll&quot; with the MSM being the troll I guess.<br>
                                            I'll just fill my TV time with movies and doc's and only use the net for weather and porn. A far more worth while expenditure of spare time.<br>

                                            <p>I know it's most distasteful, but if you were willing to try (ever so briefly, for your own well being) some of the redneck channels (10, 9, 7, et al.) you'd most certainly see that Aunty is not alone in the &quot;reporting&quot; of these leadership contentions.<br>

                                            The press is almost single-handedly responsible for these fiascos.<br>

                                            The (the press) fomented riotous speculations with Rudd, Gillard, Rudd, and previusly with Costello and Howard, and before that with Keating and Hawke.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Of course, the pollies use the press as their hounds, but the press pushes for the sensationalism.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            All very insidious, and far from the best interests of the Aust electorate.</p>

                                    <p>Malcolm's time will be after the next election.<br>
                                    Which could possibly be a DD soon after the spill but more likely some time next year.<br>
                                    The worst possible outcome for the Libs would be the removal of Abbott.<br>
                                    The best possible outcome for Labor would be Abbott's retention.<br>
                                    So the Libs are caught between a wrecking ball and very hard place.<br>
                                    The spill motion is just intended to show Abbott how really really REALLY fed up many of his colleagues are.<br>
                                    He's asked for forgiveness two or three time too many now, and while the door to his office may well be open,<br>
                                    he needs to tell his staff to stop manning the machine guns that block the way.</p>

                                    <p>Abbott fighting on is admirable, but futile. Even if he overturns the spill motion the festering wound of his leadership will continue to fester and lead to the inevitable defeat of his government at the next election.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If he had the balls to do the right thing for the country he'd stand down and throw the job open to all comers. He has no hope in that scenario.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    If he continues on in the job then it will become increasingly obvious that he is an albatross around the neck of the government and they will be fatally damaged. No senate support, no electorate support.<br>

                                    <p>I usually refrain from gloating over someone else's misfortune. Whilst I can't say that I'm enjoying watching Abbott in his current predicament, watching him squirm does provide a certain level of satisfaction. I remember Abbott as a senior head kicker in the Howard Government, cowardly mocking and sneering at people who were unemployed and on the dole. In the part of the world where I hang out, on one occasion a jumped up yobbo who ran a panel beating shop located near the dole office presumably felt so emboldened by Abbott's arrogance that they spent the whole of their smoko one morning yelling abuse at people who were going into and out of the dole office, telling them to 'get a job' and uttering profanities which I won't repeat here. It was something I will not forget. I often wonder how many young kids on the dole who had little in the way of life experience or self esteem ended up taking their own lives during the period that private school educated head kicker Abbott was vilifying and mocking the unemployed. For me, Abbott is among the lowest of the low, and as I view things, should he fall spectacularly in a heap, humiliated, with his ego shattered, his copy book blotted and his meagre record of achievement in tatters, his very public execution might perhaps serve as a warning to others of his ilk.</p>

                                    <p>Malcolm Turnbull is an ornament to Australian life and the best by far to led the Coalition and Australia.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The breakaways, Simpkins, Jensen and Entsch, are amongst the least likely to support someone like Malcolm Turnbull. He is philosophically liberal and urbane, climate change deniers amongst them. They are polar opposites in substance and style.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So this move is not about supporting Malcolm Turnbull. It feels more like an uncontrolled knee-kick born from frustration.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The phone will be running hot but, in the end, the spill will lapse for want of a challenger and the agitators will expend political credit for little gain.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    None of this should stop us dreaming that the Lodge might one day be occupied by someone so expressive and capable as Malcolm Turnbull.</p>

                                    <p>I have heard today that the PM gets to decide if it is a secret ballot or show of hands (Govt Whip, Mr Ruddock advises)<br>
                                    No guesses what he will go for...even tho Malcolm Turnbull apparently allowed for a secret ballot when Abbott challenged him. Yes whatif, those who do not support will find their way to the backbench pronto. What we need is if LNP lose the election 2016 or if called earlier, the old diehards retire so we can have some modern thinkers in parliament.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Would like to see back of Hockey - totally ineffective and MEAN treasurer...can see him whiteanting and backstabbing any new PM that may replace Abbott<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Abbott says he can only be voted out by the electorate...well the representatives of the electorate ARE your party room colleagues you fool. And as they represent the electorate they can depose you and should, as the WA MP Mr Simpkins has articulated fully. He has been supported by 2 other WA members(Interesting that they are all from WA, may be something about the distance from Canberra, that WA is often discounted!! and ignored! Treated like a quarry)</p>

I hope my tele doesn't go haywire next Monday night. It looks like a most entertaining Tuesday morning.</p>

                                    <p>I find it unlikely that Malcolm would be able to turn the Liberal barge around before it hits the rocks. Its not really a matter of leader though it is true that the leader has gotten them where they currently are. I believe that the polls are an indication of the publics horror in response to their unfair and nation wrecking policies.</p>

                                    I notice Ms. Teflon is backing Abbott in the leadership debate so when He falls she will step on him and grab the top job, sitting pretty with clean hands and no knife.</p>

                                    <p>A very smart fellow is our Malcolm, and he would have a vivid and well-informed imagination to use in his spare time. The many scenarios of 'how to become the PM' that have graced that brainspace have now been narrowed down to tactics rather than strategy, and the full thinking force will be applied to the task. As you say, Annabel, some more time will be ideal for MBT - to facilitate building direct support and moving the last few pieces of the puzzle into place. The fortunes of the LNP in the NSW election in March will be decisive. If they do ok (lose less than a dozen seats), it may slow things down, but the more likely mess made by a bat-wielding electorate should see a Turnbull infested Lodge in good time to frame a reasonable budget. That's my guess, anyway.</p>

                                    <p>If you look at history it was the rich who created poverty by exploiting those who were powerless and the rich who attempted to address the circumstances of poverty (think Charles Dickens) so enter Malcom Turnbull who is a millionaire I believe but he apparently has philanthropic tenancies so he is a classic example of the rich 'Do Gooder'. Some wonder why he is in the Liberal party maybe because he is one them from a wealthy perspective but his values are more akin to the ALP it has been said.<br>
                                    So from the point of view as to what is best for Australian people overall then I would imagine he is a better man than Tony Abbott as evidence shows Tony is off with the fairies and well and truly living in La La land. The problem with politicians is the very process of becoming one precludes them from having any realistic idea of what the average Jo (Jane)Blow experiences on a day to day basis</p>

                                    <p>Dear Annabel<br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are the only ABC journalist I listen to fully. The rest are nothing better than party hacks.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Personally, I'd be happy to make a prediction. Whether Abbott is better or Turnbull is better is, I think, a moot point. Party politics in this country have descended to name calling and abuse. So I'll happily predict that if Turnbull makes it, within three months he's be the subject of the same style of invective.</p>

                                    <p>On the evening of the Qld election, Laurie Oakes said that with the impending result, the PM was 'dead meat'. A week later, the hanging 'dead meat' is looking increasingly flyblown.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And this evening, Coalition Parliament Secretary Jamie Briggs claims that the PM is the 'only one with a plan'. What plan? God help us!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anabel is right - Turnbull has everything to gain to leave the 'dead meat' hanging, because he can wait until his panicking colleagues recruit him into the job, lest the voters cut down the fly-blown corpse at the next available election!<br></p>

                                    <p>Malcolm has played the long game. Strategically smart. He did not resign from parliament after he was rolled by Abbott, when he could have and gone off to make another fortune in the private sector. He stayed on allowing Abbott to do the dirty job and being the main villain while bringing down the Labor govt. He sat back while Hockey, another leadership contender went on to make an ass of himself in the treasurers job, the PM being of no help to him. Malcolm sat back and watched the spectacle and kept his hands clean and now they have come back to him and he can get back on his terms with no contenders for the job. He should not make any compromises to the right faction, the shock jocks , the IPA and the Nats , they may moan, groan and threaten, but have no where else to go. Its either Malcolm or doom and self interest will always triumph for them. The wily investment banker has outfoxed these amateurs.<br>

                                    <p>Malcolm is a banker, and he's become a much more cautious and patient banker. So he knows the numbers. I'd suspect that this challenge has been engineered by TA and the Prime Minister's Office in order to flush out the unready challenge, and skewer Malcolm, and Bishop, if they do anything other than show the fullest possible support. It's tricky, and meaningless. Executing the King usually takes a couple of swings of the axe. The silliness in this case is that the first swing is likely been engineered by TA. Far from innoculating him from further harm though, it will simply give the crowds a taste for blood. Loughnane, Credlin and Abbott are all on borrowed time. Meanwhile we'll be assailed by the 'speaking points' being put out by the PMO about how much the party stands behind TA. It will stick in the craw of many.</p>

                                    <p>Turnbull is playing the long game, biding his time as Mr Fraudband, and putting up with the inane behaviour of Abbott &amp; co whilst keeping a safe distance and damning them all with faint praise.<br>
                                    He would know from experience not to rattle the powers-that-be with anything even remotely resembling progressive policy, so a fairer budget or a price on carbon are definitely off the table<br>

                                    <p>Strategically, it makes sense to sit back and let Tony continue to shoot himself in various metaphorical body parts until he finishes himself off.

If - and I doubt it will come to it - he stands up, forthrightly and honestly contesting the leadership in his own right, rather than playing the reluctant recruit, we still won't get anything better from him than we have from the Liberals so far, except he won't knight British Dukes.</p>

                                    <p>If Malcolm Turnbull succeeds in overthrowing Abbott it would be the quietest and stealthiest political coup in modern times. Malcolm has been lurking somewhat in the shadows making most of his public commentary outside of Australia and sticking to the script expected of him by the Government as Communications Minister. His occasional indulgences on Q&amp;A were casual and to the point dressed in a leather jacket, which is hardly the garb of an aspirational PM. He tries to convey an outward laid back pleasantness but cannot avoid the obvious intellectual difference between himself and those he tries to confer which reveals the problem that Turnbull PM is likely to find for himself if and when he tries to delegate a change of fortune for the LNP. Turnbull the opposition leader tried to compete with K Rudd by being a benevolent critic when ALP policy closely matched his own such as the ETS, he is not an adversarial man like Abbott, it was a hard lesson for him to learn and the Godwin Grech fiasco would not have happened if he kept himself clean and left the dirty politics to others.<br>
                                    Turnbull has no doubt established a network of confidants and advisors since that time, the ambivalent environment of political ambition would be better understood and his ability to cope with those wanting to harm him politically better analysed.<br>
                                    Whether Abbott loses or Turnbull wins the prospect of the LNP turning upon itself is not something voters will be kind about.</p>
